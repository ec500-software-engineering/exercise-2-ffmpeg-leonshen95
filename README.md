# FFMPEG Video Conversion for EC500 Software Engineering

## Description

-  The program is written in Python and is supported by Mac and Linux.

- In this project, you can convert any mp4 video into 480 with 1 Mbps and 720 with 2 Mbps.

- The program is time efficient because of using threading and coroutine. The conversion jobs can be done concurrently.

## Instruction

- You can convert your own videos by replacing all "realshort.mp4" in encode.py. 

- If you attempt to convert other types of video such as "mkv", then you can do it by replacing all "mp4" accordingly in encode.py
